        <h2>1. Principles</h2>
        <p>
            Principles are general rules or guidelines that are meant to be applied in a wide range of
            situations that are often based on fundamental truths or laws.
        </p>
        <p>
            They can be used to guide
            behavior, decision-making, and problem-solving. They are essential for understanding and predicting the
            behavior of complex systems.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Cognitive Structures</h2>
        <p>Cognitive structures are basic mental patterns used to process information.</p>
        <h3>Mental Models</h3>
        <p>
            Mental models are mental representations of a person's understanding of a particular concept or system. They
            are simplified versions of reality that allow us to make sense of the world around us and make decisions
            based on that understanding.
        </p>
        <h3>Schemas</h3>
        <p>
            Schemas represent our understanding and knowledge of a particular concept or category. They are organized
            sets of information that help us understand and remember new information by relating it to what we already
            know. Schemas allow us to interpret and make sense of new experiences by organizing them into familiar
            patterns and categories.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Mindsets</h2>
        <p>
            A mindset is a person's attitude or set of beliefs about themselves and the world around them.
            It can influence how they perceive and respond to new information and experiences, and can shape their
            behaviors and actions.
