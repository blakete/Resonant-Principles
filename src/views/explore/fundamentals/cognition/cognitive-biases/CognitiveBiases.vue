                Cognitive biases refer to systematic errors in thinking that affect the decisions and judgments that people
                make.

                <li>
                    Confirmation Bias: the tendency to add more weight to information that confirms our existing beliefs,
                    while dismissing or ignoring information information that contradicts them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Availability Heuristic: making decisions based on the information that comes to mind most easily, rather
                    than all the relevant data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Self-Serving Bias: tendency to attribute positive events to our own character but attribute negative
                    events to external factors. This is a common bias that helps us maintain our self-esteem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sunk Cost Fallacy: the tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, time, or effort has

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Fundamental Attribution Error: the tendency to overvalue personality-based explanations for observed
                    human behaviors while undervaluing situational influences on behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Anchoring Bias: the tendency to over rely on the first piece of information when making decisions.

                <li>
                    Dunning-Kruger Effect: bias that occurs when people with low ability overestimate their ability and

                </li>
                <li>
