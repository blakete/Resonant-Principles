    <h1>Resonant Principles and Mental Models ☀️</h2>
        <p>
            A <b>Principle</b> is a general rules or guideline that is meant to be applied in a wide range of
            situations. Principles are often based on fundamental truths or laws, and they can be used to guide
            behavior, decision-making, and problem-solving. Principles are often abstract and can be difficult to
            define, but they are essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems.

        <p>
            A <b>Mental model</b> is a cognitive structure that represents an individual's understanding of how
            something works. It can be thought of as a mental representation of a system or concept, and it helps us
            make predictions and decisions based on our understanding of that system. Mental models can be specific to a
            particular domain or subject, or they can be more general and apply to a wider range of situations.
